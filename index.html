            <h2>Tokyo, the city that never sleeps</h2>
            <p>
              Tokyo, Japan's busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the
              traditional, from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples.
              Attractions include the Imperial Palace, encircled by stone-walled
              moats and broad gardens, and numerous temples and shrines. Tokyo
              was originally known as Edo. The name is a reference to the
              original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River
              and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of
              the city was changed to Tokyo, when it became the new imperial
              capital
